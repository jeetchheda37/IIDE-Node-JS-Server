# IIDE-Node-JS-Server
This is just a temporary repo for IIDE to test my skills <br />
Website URL: http://ec2-13-127-238-42.ap-south-1.compute.amazonaws.com:3000/blogs <br />
PLEASE NOTE:
I have only created an API Server to be used via POSTMAN App.

API Routes created:<br />
GET /blogs<br />
POST /blogs/add<br />
PUT /blogs/update<br />
DELETE /blogs/delete<br />
<br />
Each routes doesn't expect any Json Data. Please Read the comments in app.js file to better understand what's going on.


If you want the Whole website to be created please note, i wasn't sure what you guys expected so i completed the task in the shortest way possible.
it would take me atleast a day to finish the task as i am busy with other personal work too.
